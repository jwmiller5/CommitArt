# CommitArt
This was a fun little project after joining in a community discussion of the need to have an active Github profile when job hunting. I thought that was exclusionary for people whose work was private and/or caretakers who didn't have a lot of time outside of work. So I made some functions (tested as WebJobs in Azure App Service) to update a repo on a schedule, and generate a rich green quilt of Github contributions. :) 

If you look in the data folder you can see this text file that has been repeatedly modified to generate activity.
